Hello there.

I'm here setting out to write a blog about my experience with the C programming
language. While there's plenty of excellent material both online and offline
about C, I intend to use this place to communicate my journey to tame the beast.

C has certainly never been the most loved language to type in, and newcomers to
the field, like Rust and Zig, do offer ways to write safer code while retaining
the relative proximity to hardware that keeps people coming back to C. This blog
is not about trying to diminish those worthy efforts, or saying there are no
problems in C we can fix by using better tools, but it is also in recognition
that it is important to properly understand the tools we already have, and that
are the significant underpinnings of our technological stack.

As for my perspective, I like the simplicity of the language and that, while
the ergonomics cannot scale to those of more modern ones, you can still do
pretty much everything with it highly effectively. I believe you can write both
simple, expressive, beautiful and (hopefully) safe code in C.

But that is to be explored exactly here.

Blue.
